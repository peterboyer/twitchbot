<meta name="description" content="We are really pleased to announce that we're taking part in Shitbox Rally 2022 Spring!! This year, all the teams are driving their shitboxes from Mackay to Darwin.

Shitbox Rally is the largest community lead fundraiser for the Cancer Council in Australia and is now in its 13th year. Part of the participation is that all teams have to raise a minimum of $5,000 but most teams raise well above this amount as you can see with the 2022 Spring rally target set at $2,500,000 plus.

These funds go to the Cancer Council and we are extremely proud to be doing our part to support such a worthy charity. The fundraising is the hard part, so any donation you can give is greatly appreciated. Please make sure to follow our progress via this page and the blog post below.">

                  <p>Shitbox Rally is the adventure of a lifetime challenging participants and their cars, worth no more than $1,000, on a 7 day drive across Australia to raise money for cancer research.</p>
          <p>The rally is not a race – it’s a fun, colourful, unpredictable adventure with participants travelling at their own pace in smaller groups. Vehicles often break down but “we never leave anyone behind” and each night is spent camping beneath the stars and celebrating the day’s achievements. It all adds up to an incredible opportunity to see Australia’s vast and beautiful countryside and make lifelong friends, many brought together after experiencing cancer themselves or seeing cancer impact family and friends.</p>
          <p>Since it’s inception the rally has been the largest fundraiser for the Cancer Council nationally.</p>

        <div class="title">The Impact, Outcomes &amp; Charity</div>
          <p>Shitbox Rally is a dedicated fundraising event for cancer research with funds going to Cancer Council.</p>
          <p>
            Cancer Council is one of the largest non-government funders of cancer research in Australia.
            We conduct and fund research studies across all cancers and all stages of the cancer journey.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks to the community funds raised such as Shitbox Rally we can fund world-class research that reduces the impact of cancer for everyone.</p>
          <p>More than $30 million over the past 12 years has been raised by Box Rallies to date, supporting ground-breaking projects such as:</p>
          <ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li>A research study to develop a vaccine that protects against lymphoma cancers.</li>
            <li>A research trial to standardise international guidelines on melanoma removal.</li>
            <li>A research grant to revolutionise the treatment of pancreatic cancer.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These projects wouldn’t be possible without your support.</p>

This year, all the teams are driving their shitboxes from Mackay to Darwin.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nShitbox Rally is the largest community lead fundraiser for the Cancer Council in Australia and is now in its 13th year. Part of the participation is that all teams have to raise a minimum of $5,000 but most teams raise well above this amount as you can see with the 2022 Spring rally target set at $2,500,000 plus.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThese funds go to the Cancer Council and we are extremely proud to be doing our part to support such a worthy charity. The fundraising is the hard part, so any donation you can give is greatly appreciated. Please make sure to follow our progress via this page and the blog post below.","campaign_id":25,"donation_target":5000,"slug":"2-bros-chillin-in-a-shitbox","video_url":null,"is_published":1,"boxrallies_id":15694}
